# Creative

I always liked to be creative in many ways. I love playing music, but also listen to it. Without it, life would be rather dull to me. Theater, reading books, visiting musea, I can appreciate culture and art. It is a very important part of my life and I am convinced that my parents did a great job in educating me about all the culture in the world.
