# **Silent**

I am more of a silent person. I can talk very passionately about everything I do and my interests, but I like to be a soundboard for people. Listening is sometimes a very important quality and some people do appreciate that. I feel comfortable listening to people and providing them with input, but I also can stand up for my opinion when necessary and appropriate.
